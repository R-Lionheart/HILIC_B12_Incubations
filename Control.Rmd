This Control.Rmd script outlines the order in which the MESOSCOPE B12 Incubation code snippets are to be run. 

Unless otherwise stated, all inputs come from the data_raw or data_extras directories, and all outputs proceed to data_processed or figures.

## OPTIONAL CHUNK ##
If you are starting from scratch, it's a good idea to clean out the "data_processed/" and "figures/" folders so you can be sure your code is producing everything it needs for iterative analysis.

```{r Optional clean slate chunk, include=TRUE}
if(!dir.exists("data_processed"))dir.create("data_processed")
if(!dir.exists("figures"))dir.create("data_processed")

if (length(dir(path = "data_processed/")) == 0) {
  cat("\nData_processed subdirectory is empty.")
} else {
  cat("Data_processed subdirectory is not empty.\n")
}

if (length(dir(path = "figures/")) == 0) {
  cat("\nFigures subdirectory is empty.")
} else {
  cat("Figures subdirectory is not empty.\n")
}

```

As with most targeted analyses, the first step is to run the raw csv data through our Import -> Quality Control -> BMIS, and if applicable, -> Quantify.

The below chunk imports the raw MSDIAL files and combines them to one file in long format for analysis, then applies Quality Control and BMIS.
Output can be found in data_processed/ containing the keyword MSDial_combined.

*Import_files.R*
Inputs: All .csv files in the data_raw directory. This includes all Area/Mz/RT/SN files, positive and negative, from MSDial. Also includes additional supporting data (Chlorophyll information).
Outputs: One combined file titled MSDial_combined_TodaysDate.csv

*Quality_Control.R*
Inputs: MSDial combined file from previous step.
Outputs: One QC'd file titled QC_Output_TodaysDate.csv

*B12_BMIS_HILIC.R*
Inputs: Sample Key, Lab Standards, QC'd output from previous step.
Outputs: One BMIS'd file titled BMIS_Output_TodaysDate.csv

```{r Import Files, include=TRUE}
source("src/Import_files.R")
source("src/Quality_Control.R")
source("src/B12_BMIS_HILIC.R")
```

Next is to complete the preliminary stats processing; incorporate osmolytes and chlorophyll, create datasets split by eddy orientation and filter size, and run all data through an NMDS script to create a distance matrix. 

*Process_Osmolytes.R*
Inputs: Method Osmolytes file.
Outputs: Osmolytes file, edited for input into the rest of the script, titled Osmolytes_edited.csv.

*Split_by_EddyFilter.R*
Inputs: BMIS file from BMIS processing step.
Outputs: 
- BMISd file with the original T0 naming issues fixed, titled BMISd_Time0_Fixed_TodaysDate.csv
- Four files titled IsoLagranN_FilterSize_notstd.csv. Each file is the BMISd data, split by eddy and filter.

*Chl_Uploads_Standardize.R*
Inputs: 
- All four IsoLagran files from previous step.
- Chlorophyll datafile.
Outputs:
- Chlorophyll file, names fixed for future processing.
- Four files, each one normalized to ChlA (5um only, no chlorophyll exists for the 0.2um filter size). Two are non-decostandardized and in long format ("notstd"), and two are decostandardized and in wide format ("std").

*NMDS_figs.R*
Inputs:
- All four non-standardized, non-ChlA csvs split by eddy and size fraction.
- Nonstandardized, ChlA-normalized csvs split by eddy (IL1_5um, IL2_5um).
Outputs:
- Six files from inputs, all shifted to wide format and standardized.
- Six images of all NMDS figures from the output files.

```{r Preliminary processing, include=TRUE}
source("src/Process_Osmolytes.R")
source("stats_visualization/Split_by_EddyFilter.R")
source("stats_visualization/Chl_Uploads_Standardize.R")
source("stats_visualization/NMDS_figs.R")
```

After the above chunks have been run, the below scripts should be possible to run in any order, depending on your analysis interest.

The below files are not perfect and still need work, but feel free to explore any of the analytical pathways!

```{r Followup scripts}
source("stats_visualization/ANOSIM_IndicSpecies.R")
source("stats_visualization/ANOVA_all.R") #(mostly useless. needs work.)
source("stats_visualization/ANOVA_B12.R")
source("stats_visualization/ANOVA_DSW.R")
source("stats_visualization/FourCompound_Ratios.R")
source("stats_visualization/Heatmaps.R")
source("stats_visualization/Heatmps_with_Clustering.R")
source("stats_visualization/kmeans_PAM.R")
source("stats_visualization/Ratios.R")
source("stats_visualization/Raw_Plots.R")
source("stats_visualization/Univariate_Stats.R")
