## Summary of MESO-SCOPE B12 Incubations (HILIC) 
4/24/2020

### Chl-A Normalizations
#### Heatmaps

Chl-A nomalizations applied to the same dataset.
!["Cyclonic 5um"](./figures/Cyclonic_ChlvnoChl.png)

And the other set:
!["Antiyclonic 5um"](./figures/Anticyclonic_ChlvnoChl.png)

While it looks like the Cyclonic Control is more abundant in the Chl-A normalized data, that pattern doesn't seem to carry over to the Anticyclonic data. Instead, the B12-enriched sample seems to be the most abundant when normalized to Chl-A in the Anticyclonic set.

#### NMDS 

### Osmolytes
####Heatmaps, NMDS, raw

### Glutamate:Glutamine ratios
Normalize to RF and plot those ratios and percentages.
