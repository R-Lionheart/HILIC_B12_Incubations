## Summary of MESO-SCOPE B12 Incubations (HILIC) 
4/24/2020

### Chl-A Normalizations
#### Heatmaps

Chl-A nomalizations applied to the same dataset.

And the other set:
!["Antiyclonic 5um"](./figures/Anticyclonic_ChlvnoChl.png)

While it looks like the Cyclonic Control is more abundant in the Chl-A normalized data, that pattern doesn't seem to carry over to the Anticyclonic data. Instead, the B12-enriched sample seems to be the most abundant when normalized to Chl-A in the Anticyclonic set.

#### NMDS 

First, looking at the Cyclonic eddy NMDS figures with and without chlorophyll normalization. Remember that position is arbitrary, only distances are relevant.

And the Anticyclonic eddies:

There are some challenges in absorbing these graphs, one of which is that we don't have every data point. So some of the triangles are incomplete. But what I'm taking away from it is that deep seawater and no B12 have the most distinct positions, regardless of Chl normalizations.

### Osmolytes

For now I am starting with the Chl-normalized osmolyte heatmaps. I think this is a good place to start with the osmolytes, but I can also compare the Chl-normalized to the non-normalized images too.

And the Anticyclonic:

### Glutamate:Glutamine ratios
Normalize to RF and plot those ratios and percentages.
